# Polygons Problem

Here are two different solutions to the Polygon Problem

## Getting Started
The first solution uses Points, Lines and Polygons to return a list of Polygons (Polygons).
The second solution is a bit more elegant and uses PointNodes and a PaintGraph to return a List of List of points that make up a Polygon (Polygons.Graphs).

### Prerequisites

I used Java Version "13.0.1"

### Running

You can run the respective Solution.java files under either Polygons or Polygons.Graphs
```
Polygons.Solution.java
```
or 

```
Polygons.Graphs.Solution.java
```
